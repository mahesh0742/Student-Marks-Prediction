# Student-Marks-Prediction
Student Marks Prediction Using Machine Learning This project predicts student performance based on various factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation. It utilizes data preprocessing, feature encoding, and visualization techniques before applying machine learning models.
# Student Marks Prediction ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project predicts student marks based on their background and study habits using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn**. The dataset contains student performance data, which undergoes preprocessing and feature engineering before training a machine learning model.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and encodes categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses **Seaborn** for visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Computes mean scores for students.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements **Logistic Regression** for predictions.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
